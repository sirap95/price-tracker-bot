# Personal Price Tracker BOT

I've created this basic bot to track prices from Amazon.it

It will track the items that you will request and it will advice you when the price drop under your target price. 

at the moment it is a very basic bot, doesn't have a database and have a scheduler that run every 3600 seconds, so when restarted it will delete all the items in your list. 

## USAGE

### BOT TOKEN

Create your bot with bot_father on Telegram, when it generate the BOT_TOKEN paste it in config.py
```
  BOT_TOKEN = 'ADD_YOUR_TOKEN'
```

### TELEGRAM USAGE

BOT COMMANDS: 

```
  /start (start the bot) DONE
  /add (add a new item to track) DONE
  /list (it return the list of item on track) DONE
  /remove (remove an item from the list) WIP
```
